# The friendly fe'e

A Samoan proverbs project. 

This is a starter project that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code.

## Separate client/server

The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
