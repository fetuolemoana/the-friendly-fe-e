    topic: 'fishing',
    type: ["upu alofa: expressions of love, compassion, and sympathy", "upu fa'aulaula: raillery, ridicule, jests"],
    description: "The feathers of certain birds, e.g., the tava‘e or tropic bird, are attached to the fish-hook to serve as artificial bait. Before the introduction of firearms, this bird was caught in the following way: The hunter searched for a nest with young and climbed up to it. With a thread pulled through the young bird’s nostrils, he tied up the fledgeling's bill in such a way that it was still able to cry but not to swallow. When the parents returned, they were so terrified at the young one's inability to eat, that they left all caution aside and could be caught easily. The Samoans maintain that if the parents were left undisturbed, they would remain with their young and allow themselves to starve to death. Loving words referring to friends who stick together through thick and thin. Ta te gase a uluga. Words of encouragement: Let us die together.",

The best hooks are those with a perfectly white pearl shell shaft. Words of praise referring to the speech of one high chief or orator and the reply made by another.",
